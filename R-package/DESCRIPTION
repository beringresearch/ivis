Description: Implementation of the ivis algorithm as described in the paper:
  'Structure-preserving visualisation of high dimensional single-cell data'.
  This algorithm uses a siamese neural network trained on triplets to reduce the dimensionality of data to two dimensions for visualization.
  Each triplet is sampled from one of the k nearest neighbours as approximated by the Annoy library, with neighbouring points being pulled
  together and non-neighours being pushed away.
