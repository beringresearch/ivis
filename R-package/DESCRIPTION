Description: Implementation of the ivis algorithm as described in the paper:
  'Structure-preserving visualisation of high dimensional single-cell data'.
  This algorithm uses a siamese neural network trained on triplets to reduce
  the dimensionality of data to two dimensions for visualization. Each triplet
  is sampled from one of the k nearest neighbours as approximated by the Annoy library,
  with neighbouring points being pulled together and non-neighours being pushed away.
