``ivis`` is a machine learning library for reducing dimensionality of very large datasets using Siamese Neural Networks. ``ivis`` preserves global data structures in a low-dimensional space, adds new data points to existing embeddings using a parametric mapping function, and scales linearly to millions of observations. The algorithm is described in detail in `Structure-preserving visualisation of high dimensional single-cell datasets <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-45301-0>`_.
