Supervised Dimensionality Reduction with ivis
=============================================

ivis is able to make use of any provided class labels to perform supervised
dimensionality reduction. Supervised embeddings combine the distance-based
characteristics of the unsupervised ivis algorithm with clear class boundaries
between the class categories. The resulting embeddings encode relevant
class-specific information into lower dimensional space, making them useful
for enhancing the performance of a classifier.

To train ivis in supervised mode, simply provide the labels to the fit
methodâ€™s Y parameter. These labels should be a list of 0-indexed integers with
each integer corresponding to a class.

    import numpy as np
    from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist
    from ivis import Ivis

    (X_train, Y_train), (X_test, Y_test) = mnist.load_data()

    # Rescale to 0-1
    X_train = X_train / 255.
    X_test = X_test / 255.

    # Flatten images to 1D vectors
    X_train = np.reshape(X_train, (len(X_train), 28 * 28))
    X_test = np.reshape(X_test, (len(X_test), 28 * 28))

    model = Ivis(n_epochs_without_progress=5)
    model.fit(X_train, Y_train)
