"""
Supervised Dimensionality Reduction with ivis
=============================================

ivis is able to make use of any provided class labels to perform supervised
dimensionality reduction. Supervised embeddings combine the distance-based
characteristics of the unsupervised ivis algorithm with clear class boundaries
between the class categories. The resulting embeddings encode relevant
class-specific information into lower dimensional space, making them useful
for enhancing the performance of a classifier.

To train ivis in supervised mode, simply provide the labels to the fit
methodâ€™s Y parameter. These labels should be a list of 0-indexed integers with
each integer corresponding to a class.
